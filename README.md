# LPIPV Dataset

The LPIPV dataset (Legal Proceeding with Intimate Partner Violence) contains information regarding the disengagement from the legal proceedings by women victims of intimate partner violence in Spain.

This dataset includes multiple psychological, demographic, and emotional variables collected through questionnaires administered to women victims of gender-based violence who, at some point, began legal proceedings against their abuser and which had already ended at the time of the interview (either because they ended the procedure or because they withdraw from it).

The purpose of this dataset is to help find the relationship between the abandonment of the judicial process with the various variables collected.
